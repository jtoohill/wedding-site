    <h2>Our Story</h2>

      <p>We met in the summer of 2012 when we were starry-eyed interns working on the same team at Google in California. At the end, Shannon returned to Vancouver and Jon to New York, telling each other that a three-hour time difference and 3000 miles was probably too much to keep anything going. A few months later, we were still talking every single day and the Skype calls were getting longer and longer, so we decided to make it official.</p>

      <p>Fast-forward a year of long distance, a few years in California, the addition of two fuzzy cats and a move to Seattle, we were visiting Jon’s parents in Massachusetts in February 2018. Shannon loves the Boston aquarium and Jon had patiently let her admire the penguins all afternoon. We were walking to dinner (in -5°C/20°F weather) when Jon asked Shannon to sit on a bench in a quiet little park underneath some Valentine Day’s lights. Shannon thought he was crazy because it was so cold, but he insisted. Shannon sat, and he took out a ring.</p>
