    <h2>Our Story</h2>

      <p>Shannon and Jon met in the summer of 2012 when they were starry-eyed interns working on the same team at Google in California. At the end, Shannon returned to Vancouver and Jon to New York, but daily Skype calls made the 3000 mile and 3 time zone difference feel a little smaller. Jon flew to Vancouver to visit Shannon on New Years' Day in 2013, and that's when they made it official. After a year of long distance, a few years in California, and the addition of two fuzzy cats, they finally ended up in Seattle.</p>

      <p class="left">In February 2018, they were visiting Jon’s parents in Massachusetts. Shannon loves the New England Aquarium and Jon had patiently let her admire the penguins all afternoon. They were walking to dinner (in -5°C/20°F weather) when Jon asked Shannon to sit on a bench in a quiet little park underneath some Valentine Day’s lights. Shannon thought he was crazy because it was so cold, but he insisted. Shannon sat down, and Jon went down on one knee.</p>
