    <h2>Travel Info</h2>
    <p>As a reminder to those traveling from outside Canada, <b>be sure to have a current passport.</b></p>
    <h3>Getting there</h3>
    <p>The major airport for Vancouver is YVR (Vancouver International Airport). The airport has a joining Skytrain link that will take you to downtown in about 30 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Accomodation</h3>
    <p>We recommend staying in the downtown area of Vancouver, as there is lots to see and do and good public transit. Any hotel that is walking distance to a Skytrain station is a good choice.</p>
    <h3>Getting around</h3>
    <p>We will provide a shuttle from downtown Vancouver to the venue. If you are staying downtown, it's fairly easy to use public transit (Skytrain and bus) to get around. If you are staying outside of the downtown core, you will most likely need a car as there is no public transit to the venue. Lyft and Uber don't operate in Vancouver, so don't plan on using them!</p>
